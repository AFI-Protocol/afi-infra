# ðŸ§  Agent Execution Trace Schema: Prompt Summary

You are tasked with generating detailed execution traces for agentic behavior across financial, analytical, and logic-based tasks. This schema supports structured reflection, performance reviews, and training oversight.

You MUST:
- Record every step the agent takes, including timestamps and decisions made.
- Include input/output for each step if relevant.
- Assign a confidence score if the model generates one.
- Annotate any notes or relevant metadata.

This trace may be used by future evaluators, fine-tuning loops, or debugging systems.
